# Cities: Skylines - Extended Public Transport UI
Extends the public transport UI with additional list views and toggles for bus, metro and train. Nicely integrates with the native UI. Just press the bus, metro or train panel in the public transport panel to bring up the extended UI.

## Features
* Toggle visibility of all lines with one click
* Toggle visibility of individual public transport lines
* Automatically hides transport lines of all other types
* Hover over line name to highlight

## New in 1.1
* Zebra stripe background
* Panel is now scrollable
* Hidden lines don't reappear anymore when in edit mode
* Fixed checkboxes in almost all cases

## Known Issues
* **Sometimes doesn't open when loading a savegame. Workaround: Load again.**
* Very long line names don't fit
* Color picker doesn't work
* Checkbox misbehaves when hovering over a line in edit mode
* While hovering over the name label in edit mode the line disappears
