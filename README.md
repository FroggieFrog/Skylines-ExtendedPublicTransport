# Cities: Skylines - Extended Public Transport UI
Extends the Public Transport UI with additional list views and toggles for Bus, Metro and Train. Nicely integrates with the native UI. Just press the Bus, Metro or Train panel in the Public Transport Info Panel to bring up the extended UI.

## Features
* Toggle visibility of all lines with one click
* Toggle visibility of individual public transport lines
* Automatically hides transport lines of all other types
* Hover over line name to highlight

## Known Issues
* In edit mode: hovering over lines makes them reappear
* Very long line names don't fit
* List might grow too big
* Colorpicker doesn't work
* And more...
